 ## LinkedIn Job Scraper and Google Sheets Updater

This Python script automates the process of scraping job details from LinkedIn job postings and updating a Google Sheet with the collected information. It's designed to help job seekers efficiently track and organize job applications.

## Features

- Scrapes job details from LinkedIn job postings
- Updates a Google Sheet with the scraped information
- Implements measures to bypass basic scraping protections
- Uses Google Sheets API for seamless integration
- Implements measures to bypass basic scraping protections

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- A Google Cloud Platform account with Google Sheets API enabled
- A service account key file (JSON) for Google Sheets API authentication
- A Sheet ID

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ramunasnognys/LinkedInToSheets.git
   cd LinkedInToSheets
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
   ```

3. Place your Google Sheets API service account key file (named `job-sheet.json`) in the same directory as the script.

## Configuration

1. Open `app.py` and replace the `sheet_id` variable with your Google Sheet ID:
   ```python
   sheet_id = 'your-google-sheet-id-here'
   ```

2. Ensure your Google Sheet has the following columns in order:
   - Company
   - Position
   - Location
   - Date Applied
   - Status
   - Notes
   - Website
   - Skills/Description

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```

2. When prompted, enter the full LinkedIn job posting URL.

3. The script will:
    - Read all data from your Google Sheet
    - Skip rows that already have content in columns A-F
    - For empty rows, scrape data for the URL in column G if it's valid
    - Update the sheet with the new information for empty rows only

## How It Works
1. The script uses requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape job details from LinkedIn job postings.
2. It implements measures to bypass basic scraping protections, such as random user agents and request delays.
3. The scraped data is then formatted and sent to the specified Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API.
4. Existing data in the sheet is preserved, and only empty rows are updated with new information.

## Limitations

- Web scraping may violate LinkedIn's terms of service. Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
- The script may break if LinkedIn changes its HTML structure.
- There's a possibility of being blocked by LinkedIn if used excessively.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the script are welcome. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
4. Push to the original branch: `git push origin feature-branch-name`.
5. Create the pull request.

## New Feature Ideas ðŸ’¡
1. **Multi-platform Job Scraping:**
    - Expand the scraper to work with other job platforms like Indeed, Glassdoor, or Monster. This would allow users to aggregate job listings from multiple sources in one sheet.
2. **Automatic Application Tracking:**
    - Implement a feature that automatically updates the "Date Applied" and "Status" columns based on user-defined triggers or actions. For example, it could mark a job as "Applied" when the user clicks a specific button or after a certain time has passed.
3. **Job Recommendation System:**
    - Analyze the scraped job descriptions and the user's resume/skills (which could be stored in a separate sheet) to provide a matching score or recommendation for each job listing. This could help users prioritize which jobs to apply for.
4. **Email Notifications:**
    - Set up an email notification system that alerts the user when new jobs matching their criteria are added to the sheet, or when it's time to follow up on an application based on the application date.
5. **Data Visualization Dashboard:**
    - Create a separate sheet or a Google Data Studio dashboard that visualizes the job search progress. This could include charts showing application status distribution, timeline of applications, most common skills required in the job listings, etc.
